## Description

Travel presents a lot of great opportunities to you, including making your friends jealous! Giphy Travel Guide allows you to search different travel destinations and have it present you with Gifs related to your searched destination. 

Working on this project, we were able to learn how to code as a team. We were able to learn about different APIs including the Google Maps API, the Giphy API, TailWind CSS, and Jquery. By building our site from scratch, we were able to experience every aspect of development. We were able to come up with the idea of the site, the tasks that needed to be done, the division of responsibilities, and ensuring all tasks are completed. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You can use the searchbar on the map to search for a destination. If you are undecided, you can use the Surprise Me button to randomly select a top travel destination based on Lonely Planet's Best Places to Visit in 2023. 

When you search a destination, you can revisit the previous searches by clicking on the flag pins on the map with the previous destinations. 

You can use the Search Again button to search a new destination.
