## Description

Travel presents a lot of great opportunities to you, including making your family and friends jealous! Giphy Travel Guide allows you to search different travel destinations and have it present you with gifs related to your searched destination. You can use this to see the traditions, cultures or popular events for your searched destination. You can also use the site to get prepared with the gifs you will send to your family and friends!

Working on this project, we were able to learn how to code as a team. We were able to learn about different APIs including the Google Maps API, the Giphy API, TailWind CSS, and Jquery. By building our site from scratch, we were able to experience every aspect of development. We were able to come up with the idea of the site, the tasks that needed to be done, the division of responsibilities, and ensuring all tasks are completed.
